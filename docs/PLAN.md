# NeoForge Development Plan: Current Status & Next Steps

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: NeoForge CI/CD pipeline fixes are **IN PROGRESS**. Previous session established excellent technical foundations and comprehensive 4-epic plan. Current session has been focused on **Epic 1 implementation** with specific focus on pipeline stability and security scanning resolution.

**Strategic Focus**: Complete Epic 1 (CI/CD Pipeline Excellence) then proceed with remaining 3 epics for enterprise-grade production excellence.

## 🎯 Current Work Status (Epic 1: CI/CD Pipeline Excellence)

### ✅ **COMPLETED** (Current Session)
1. **ESLint Security Issues Fixed**
   - Fixed variable declaration in `color-picker.js` (const vs let issue)
   - Removed undefined showToast reference in `base-page-component.js`
   - Fixed unused variable imports in `design-integration.js`
   - Prefixed unused parameters with underscore for ESLint compliance
   - Committed: `fix: resolve ESLint security issues`

2. **Workflow Optimization Started**
   - Updated `optimized-tests.yml` to use Bun instead of npm
   - Removed incorrect package-lock.json dependency path
   - Configured Bun setup and install for frontend tests
   - Committed: `fix: update optimized-tests workflow to use Bun instead of npm`

3. **Security Workflow Analysis**
   - Created comprehensive analysis in `docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS_AND_FIX_PLAN.md`
   - Identified key failure points in security scanning pipeline
   - Implemented fallback values for missing secrets
   - Fixed container security scanning upload conflicts

### 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**
1. **GitHub Actions Pipeline Fixes**
   - Security scanning workflow needs testing
   - Production build workflow improvements applied
   - Accessibility testing port configurations
   - Backend/frontend test workflow alignment with Bun

2. **Auth Integration Completion**
   - Backend auth endpoints partially implemented
   - Frontend auth service needs baseUrl correction (was `/api/auth`, should be `/api/v1/auth`)
   - Missing /login, /me, /validate endpoints implementation
   - Frontend-backend API alignment needed

### ⏳ **NEXT IMMEDIATE TASKS**

#### Priority 1: Complete Pipeline Fixes (This Session)
1. **Validate Current Workflow Fixes**
   ```bash
   gh run list --branch fix/pipeline-issues --limit 5
   # Monitor for successful runs after latest commits
   ```

2. **Fix Remaining Workflow Issues**
   - Address any remaining security scanning failures
   - Fix backend test dependencies and Docker issues
   - Ensure all workflows use Bun consistently

3. **Test Workflow End-to-End**
   - Create PR to trigger all workflows
   - Validate 95% success rate target
   - Measure build time improvements

#### Priority 2: Complete Auth Integration (Next Session)
1. **Backend API Endpoints**
   ```python
   # File: backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py
   # Add missing endpoints:
   @router.post("/login", response_model=Token)  # JSON-based login
   @router.get("/me", response_model=UserResponse)  # User profile
   @router.post("/validate", response_model=dict)  # Token validation
   ```

2. **Frontend Auth Service Fixes**
   ```javascript
   // File: frontend/src/services/auth.js
   this.baseUrl = "/api/v1/auth";  // Fix base URL
   // Update all methods to match backend API format
   ```

- Build time optimization

#### ⏳ Remaining Work
1. **Performance Test Threshold Optimization**
   ```javascript
   // File: frontend/src/test/performance/performance.test.js
   const PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS = {
     componentRender: 25,  // Increased from 16.67ms for CI stability
     listUpdate: 50,       // Added buffer for CI environment  
     formValidation: 20    // Account for CI overhead
   };
   ```

2. **Smart Build Matrix Implementation**
   ```yaml
   # File: .github/workflows/smart-ci.yml (NEW)
   strategy:
     fail-fast: false
     matrix:
       test-type: [unit, integration, e2e, security, accessibility]
       include:
         - test-type: unit
           timeout: 5
         - test-type: integration  
           timeout: 10
   ```

3. **Test Parallelization Enhancement**
   ```yaml
   # File: .github/workflows/test.yml
   strategy:
     matrix:
       shard: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Increase from current 3 to 5 shards
   ```

**Success Metrics**:
- Build Time: 5-10 minutes → **3 minutes** (Currently ~7 minutes)
