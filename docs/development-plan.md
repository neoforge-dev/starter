# NeoForge Development Plan

## Overview Update
As of the current implementation, the core backend infrastructure is in place with a working FastAPI application, database integration, middleware, and testing framework. The following plan has been updated to prioritize critical backend improvements before shifting focus to the frontend development.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup (Completed / In Progress)
- Project Scaffolding: Established initial cookiecutter structure and basic configurations.
- FastAPI Application Setup: Initial FastAPI setup completed. Pending finalization of middleware (CORS, logging, error handling) and health check endpoints.
- Database Configuration: Postgres is configured for development; ensure connection stability.
- Pydantic Integration: Basic data validation is in place; further validation refinements required.
- MLflow Setup: MLflow installed for model metrics tracking; integration to be detailed in upcoming steps.
- Continuous Integration: Docker, Make, and pytest configurations are operational.

## Phase 2: Backend Critical Features
**Critical tasks to tackle immediately:**
- Finalize core API endpoints:
  - Health Check endpoint verification.
  - Robust User Authentication flow secured with Pydantic validations.
- Middleware Enhancements:
  - Complete integration of CORS, logging, and error handling.
  - Incorporate MLflow for real-time metrics logging and monitoring.
- Email & File Handling:
  - Finalize email integration using fastapi-mail.
  - Implement and test file upload endpoints.
- Testing & Documentation:
  - Increase test coverage to at least 80% using pytest.
  - Update API documentation with OpenAPI specifications.
  - Record architecture decisions in ADRs and maintain version history in CHANGELOG.md.

## Phase 3: Frontend Development
- Focus on essential frontend components (authentication, API client, routing) after backend critical tasks are completed.
- Create a modern, professional landing page showcasing the starter kit
- Implement interactive documentation with live examples
