# 4. Token-Based Authentication Strategy

Date: 2024-02-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed to implement a secure, scalable authentication system that works well with our PWA architecture and supports offline capabilities. The main options considered were:

1. Session-based authentication
2. JWT tokens
3. OAuth 2.0
4. Magic links
5. WebAuthn

Key requirements:
- Secure token storage
- Offline support
- Multiple device support
- Password reset flow
- Remember me functionality
- Rate limiting

## Decision

We decided to implement a hybrid token-based authentication system:

1. **Access Tokens**: Short-lived JWTs for API authentication
2. **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived secure HTTP-only cookies
3. **Local Storage**: For PWA offline support
4. **Service Worker**: For token refresh and request queueing

Implementation details:
- Access tokens expire after 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens valid for 7 days
- Automatic token refresh
- Secure token storage in HTTP-only cookies
- CSRF protection via double-submit pattern

## Consequences

### Positive

- Secure token management
- Works offline
- Supports multiple devices
- Easy to scale
- Clear logout mechanism
- Good security practices

### Negative

- More complex than session auth
- Need careful token management
- Additional network requests
- Complex offline scenarios

### Mitigations

1. Implemented automatic token refresh
2. Added token validation in service worker
3. Created clear security guidelines
4. Added monitoring for auth issues
5. Implemented proper error handling

## Notes

- Tokens are never stored in localStorage
- All auth requests use HTTPS
- Implements PKCE for additional security
- Supports password reset via email
- Includes rate limiting on auth endpoints
