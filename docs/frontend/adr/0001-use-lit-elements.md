# 1. Use Lit Elements for Web Components

Date: 2024-02-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed to choose a web component framework for building our UI components. The main options considered were:

1. Vanilla Web Components
2. Lit Elements
3. Stencil
4. Fast
5. Svelte

Key considerations:
- Development speed and ease
- Bundle size and performance
- Browser support
- Community and ecosystem
- Learning curve
- Testing capabilities

## Decision

We decided to use Lit Elements for our web components because:

1. **Minimal Runtime**: Lit is extremely lightweight (~5KB) and has no external dependencies
2. **Native Web Standards**: Built on standard Web Components, making it future-proof
3. **Simple API**: Provides an intuitive, React-like API without the complexity
4. **Great Performance**: Efficient rendering with minimal overhead
5. **Strong TypeScript Support**: Though we use vanilla JS, the types help with documentation
6. **Active Community**: Backed by Google, used in major projects
7. **Easy Testing**: Works well with standard web component testing tools

## Consequences

### Positive

- Reduced boilerplate compared to vanilla web components
- Excellent performance characteristics
- Easy to debug with browser dev tools
- Simple integration with other web components
- Clear upgrade path if needed

### Negative

- Small learning curve for developers new to web components
- Some polyfills needed for older browsers
- Less ecosystem compared to React/Vue

### Mitigations

1. Created comprehensive documentation and examples
2. Added browser support matrix
3. Implemented automated testing
4. Created shared component library
