# 3. PWA-First Architecture

Date: 2024-02-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Modern web applications need to provide a native-like experience while maintaining the reach and accessibility of the web. We needed to decide how to approach offline support, installation, and performance optimization.

Key considerations:
- Offline functionality
- Installation capability
- Performance
- User experience
- Development complexity
- Maintenance burden

## Decision

We decided to adopt a PWA-first architecture, implementing:

1. **Service Worker**: For offline support and resource caching
2. **Web App Manifest**: For installability and native-like experience
3. **Offline First**: Core functionality works without network
4. **Push Notifications**: For user engagement (where appropriate)
5. **Background Sync**: For offline data persistence

Implementation approach:
- Use service worker for network caching
- Implement app shell architecture
- Cache critical resources
- Use IndexedDB for offline data
- Support background updates

## Consequences

### Positive

- Better user experience
- Offline functionality
- Improved performance
- Native-like features
- Better engagement
- Reduced server load

### Negative

- Additional complexity
- Service worker debugging challenges
- Need for careful cache management
- Additional testing requirements

### Mitigations

1. Created service worker testing suite
2. Implemented cache versioning
3. Added debugging tools
4. Created clear cache strategies
5. Added monitoring for service worker issues

## Notes

- Service worker scope is limited to /
- Cache strategy varies by resource type
- Push notifications are opt-in
- Background sync requires careful error handling
