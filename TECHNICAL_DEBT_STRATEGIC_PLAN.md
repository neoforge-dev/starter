## Phase 6A: Systematic Technical Debt Remediation

### **Objective**: Address remaining 224 ESLint issues and improve code quality

#### **6A.1 ESLint Issue Classification and Batch Processing**
```yaml
Issue Categories (Current 224):
  Unused Variables (Est. 150):

    - Component props: Requires analysis
  
  Code Quality (Est. 50):
    - Prototype access violations
    - Setter return values
    - Inner function declarations
  
  Undefined Variables (Est. 24):
    - Missing imports
    - Typos in variable names
    - Library reference issues
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Batch 1**: Safe removals (unused imports, test variables)
- **Batch 2**: Story file parameter cleanup
- **Batch 3**: Component prop analysis and optimization
- **Batch 4**: Code quality improvements
- **Batch 5**: Undefined variable resolution

#### **6A.2 Test Coverage Analysis and Improvement**
```bash
# Coverage analysis workflow
npm run test:coverage -- --reporter=html
# Target: >90% coverage for critical paths
# Focus areas: API endpoints, authentication, data mutations
```

**Coverage Targets:**
- [ ] Frontend: 85% statement coverage (currently unknown)
- [ ] Backend: Maintain 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Integration tests: 80% critical flow coverage
- [ ] E2E tests: 100% user journey coverage
