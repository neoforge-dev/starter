## Outstanding Work Required

### 🔴 **Critical (Phase 2 - Week 1)**
1. **CSS Bundle Reduction**: 7.37KB → <5KB target
   - Extract critical CSS (1KB above-fold styles)
   - Component-specific CSS optimization
   - Remove unused global styles

2. **Main Bundle Optimization**: 15.21KB → <12KB target  
   - Code splitting for non-critical components
   - Lazy loading implementation
   - Tree shaking improvements

3. **Core Bundle Minimization**: 13.65KB → <8KB target
   - Move non-essential features to separate bundles
   - Optimize service loading strategy

### 🟡 **High Priority (Phase 2 - Week 2)**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Deploy AtomComponent**: Start migrating simple atoms to new base class
2. **Enable Bundle Monitoring**: Add to CI/CD pipeline with size budgets  
3. **Begin CSS Optimization**: Extract critical styles for above-fold content

### Strategic Decisions (Next Month)
1. **Component Split Strategy**: Maintain both simple/advanced versions of complex atoms
2. **Performance Budget**: Set strict 50KB limit with automated enforcement
3. **Architecture Review**: Consider micro-frontend approach for largest organisms

### Long-term Evolution (Next Quarter)
1. **Dynamic Loading**: Implement smart component lazy loading
2. **Performance Analytics**: User experience monitoring integration
3. **Framework Agnostic**: Consider web component standards compliance
