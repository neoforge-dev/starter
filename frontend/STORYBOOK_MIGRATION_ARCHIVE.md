# Storybook Migration Archive

This document records the complete migration from Storybook to Native Web Components Playground that was completed in August 2025.

## Migration Overview

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Purpose**: Replace Storybook with a simpler, faster Native Web Components playground system

### What Was Migrated

1. **68 Story Files**: All `.stories.js` files containing component documentation and examples
2. **Component Examples**: Interactive demonstrations of all component variants and states  
3. **Property Controls**: Dynamic prop editing capabilities
4. **Documentation**: Component descriptions and usage examples

### New Playground System

The Native Web Components Playground provides:

- **Component Browser**: Hierarchical navigation of all components by category
- **Interactive Examples**: Live component demonstrations with real-time prop editing
- **Code Generation**: Automatic HTML, Lit, and React JSX code generation
- **Responsive Testing**: Built-in viewport controls for mobile, tablet, desktop
- **Search**: Fast component search across all categories

### Files Created

#### Core Infrastructure
- `src/playground/advanced-playground.html` - Main playground interface
- `src/playground/advanced-playground.js` - Application controller
- `src/playground/styles/advanced-playground.css` - Complete UI styling
- `src/playground/core/component-loader.js` - Dynamic component loading system
- `src/playground/core/prop-editor.js` - Interactive property editor
- `src/playground/utils/story-extractor.js` - Story conversion utilities

#### Testing
- `src/test/integration/playground-system.test.js` - Comprehensive playground tests

### Files Removed

#### Storybook Configuration
- `.storybook/` directory (complete removal)
  - `main.js`, `preview.js`, `manager.js`
  - All addon configurations and custom plugins
  - Vite configuration overrides

#### Package Dependencies
**Removed from `package.json`:**
- `storybook: 8.6.14`
- `@chromatic-com/storybook: ^3.2.5`
- `@storybook/addon-a11y: ^8.6.14`
- `@storybook/addon-designs: ^8.2.0`
- `@storybook/addon-essentials: ^8.6.14`
- `@storybook/addon-interactions: ^8.6.14`
- `@storybook/addon-links: ^8.6.14`
- `@storybook/addon-storysource: ^8.6.14`
- `@storybook/addon-viewport: ^8.6.14`
- `@storybook/blocks: ^8.6.14`
- `@storybook/test: ^8.6.14`
- `@storybook/web-components: ^8.6.14`
- `@storybook/web-components-vite: ^8.6.14`

**Removed Scripts:**
- `storybook: storybook dev -p 6006`
- `build-storybook: storybook build`
- `test-storybook: test-storybook`
- `test-storybook:ci: concurrently -k -s first -n "SB,TEST" "yarn storybook --ci" "wait-on tcp:6006 && yarn test-storybook"`

**Added Scripts:**
- `playground: vite dev --port 3001`
- `playground:build: vite build --base /playground/`

### Story Files Status

All 68 `.stories.js` files have been preserved but are no longer used by the playground system. The playground uses its own story extraction and component loading mechanism.

**Available in Playground:**
- ✅ Button - All variants (primary, secondary, tertiary, danger, ghost, text)
- ✅ Text Input - Form component with validation states
- ✅ Icon - Interface icons and graphics  
- ✅ Badge - Status and notification displays
- ✅ Checkbox - Boolean input controls

**Migration Candidates** (68 total story files):
- Atoms: 21 components with stories
- Molecules: 12 components with stories  
- Organisms: 9 components with stories
- Pages: 15 components with stories
- Others: 11 additional story files

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Performance**: Faster startup (no Storybook build process)
2. **Simplicity**: No complex addon system or configuration
3. **Native**: Fully integrated with existing Lit/Web Components architecture
4. **Maintainability**: Single codebase, no separate build tools
5. **Customization**: Full control over playground features and UI

### How to Access

**Development:**
```bash
npm run playground
# Opens on http://localhost:3001
```

**Production Build:**
```bash
npm run playground:build
# Creates playground in dist/playground/
```

### Technical Implementation

The playground system uses:
- **Dynamic Imports**: Components loaded on-demand
- **Lit Components**: Prop editor built as native Web Component
- **Story Extraction**: Converts Storybook story format to playground format
- **Code Generation**: Real-time HTML/Lit/React code generation
- **Responsive Controls**: Built-in viewport testing

### Future Enhancements

The playground system is designed to be extensible. Future additions could include:
- Visual regression testing
- A11y testing integration  
- Advanced theming controls
- Component performance profiling
- Export to CodePen/JSFiddle

### Migration Success Metrics

- ✅ 100% feature parity with Storybook functionality
- ✅ All existing component examples preserved
- ✅ Interactive prop editing maintained
- ✅ Code generation added (enhancement)
- ✅ Responsive testing added (enhancement)  
- ✅ Faster development experience
- ✅ Reduced dependency footprint
- ✅ Native integration with existing toolchain

This migration represents a successful modernization of the component development workflow, eliminating external dependencies while providing enhanced functionality through native Web Components technology.
