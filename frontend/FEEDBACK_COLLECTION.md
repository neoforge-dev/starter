## 📈 Usage Analytics (To Be Collected)

### Component Popularity
```
[ ] Track which components are loaded most frequently
[ ] Measure time spent in each component
[ ] Identify unused components for potential optimization
```

### Feature Adoption
```
[ ] Keyboard shortcut usage frequency
[ ] Search query patterns and success rates
[ ] Prop editor interaction patterns
[ ] Code generation feature usage
```

### Performance Monitoring
```
[ ] Component switching times in production

```

## 🎯 Hypothesis for Next Iteration

### Based on First Principles Analysis:

**Primary Hypothesis:** Users will need **organism-level components** (tables, forms, layouts) to complete real application development workflows.

**Secondary Hypothesis:** **Integration features** (export to CodePen, Figma sync, design token integration) will provide significant value for design-development collaboration.

**Performance Hypothesis:** Current performance is probably overkill - users may value **additional functionality** over further speed improvements.

## 🚀 Potential Next Iteration Focus Areas

### Tier 1: High-Impact, High-Certainty
1. **Data Display Components**
   - `<neo-table>` with sorting, filtering, pagination
   - `<neo-list>` with virtualization
   - `<neo-data-grid>` for complex data

2. **Advanced Form Components**
   - `<neo-multi-select>` with search
   - `<neo-file-upload>` with drag/drop
   - `<neo-rich-text>` editor integration

3. **Layout Components**
   - `<neo-sidebar>` with responsive behavior
   - `<neo-header>` with navigation
   - `<neo-footer>` with links and content

### Tier 2: Medium-Impact, High-Value
4. **Design Integration**
   - Design token system integration
   - Theme switching capabilities
   - Export to design tools

5. **Advanced Testing**
   - Accessibility testing integration
   - Performance profiling
   - Cross-browser automated testing

6. **Developer Productivity**
   - Component templates/scaffolding
   - Bulk property testing modes
   - Advanced code generation (full component usage examples)

### Tier 3: Future Considerations
